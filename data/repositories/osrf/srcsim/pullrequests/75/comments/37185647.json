Now, all my walking algorithms are custom however so i don't know how well to really compare to the walking script but at the 0.3 RTF with the speed enhancement without the new val-gazebo package it is fine but doesn't achieve 100% speed boost. The robot still wobbles a lot though but not in the way like earlier with the new package which was more on the jittery than wobbly. With the new package however things do reach the 0.70RTF range on an empty world but the robot just jitters uncontrollably on my side. 0.45RTF on an empty world without the new package.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>After reverting to the old one using your commands the robot doesn't exactly achieve double simulation speeds, rather it's like 50% increase in speed with the step changes.
