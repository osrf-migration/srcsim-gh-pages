The major reason we were 'late' was the hardware was always late. But nobody seemed to correlate that with why the software got delayed. Not to mention all the simple, one-off software I had to write to demonstrate to the hardware guys where that line that was supposed to be high was actually low. \"Fix it in software\" was the response. Then in next version of the hardware they would fix it. Now the software had to determine the version of hardware to do the right thing.\n\nHope some of you will be at JSC at the end of the month.
