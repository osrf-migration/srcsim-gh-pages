Answering:\n\n* I used the same spring stiffness as in the solar panel button, and I've been successful pressing that teleoperating Val. There's no target force to achieve, we just need to make sure it's reasonable that the robot could make it. Unlike the solar panel, here teams might want to press the button with a single finger, and I haven't tried that. Now that we have a grasping controller it can be tried, I'll give this a try right now. Even after we try, it's possible that teams will come back with feedback saying that the button doesn't work right, so we might tweak it again later.\n* The rules don't specify the weight, I just chose something which seemed reasonable and Val should be able to lift with one arm.\n* Yeah that's a good point. I'm not worrying too much about the positioning at the moment since it's all placeholders. The idea will be to randomly position the tools on the table.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks for the thorough review!
