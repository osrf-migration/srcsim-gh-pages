It's a little small and needs a rigid end, but would do in a pinch.\nLook at the EVA handrails for the ideal size.  The EVA powertool is another good example.  You have to hold most things with your thumb and fingers rather than in your palm.  That is because the glove is somewhat bulky but the finger and thumb ends are excellent.  FInger and thumb agility is a major difference between the US and Russian suits.  Nevertheless, the limiting strength and endurance factor for EVA is in your hands.  There are a ton of techniques and moves to minimize hand use.  Look carefully at how an experienced spacewalker transits hand rails and orients their body.  You will see that the hands are mostly relaxed.  Nevertheless, for two years I always had a handball with me, so that when I was was walking or driving or sitting around, I could squeeze and release it to improve hand strength and endurance.  When the STS-96 EVA went overtime from the planned 6 hours to 8 hours, that training paid off very well.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>The cable might actually be OK for EVA.
