There is a parameter \"effort\" in the joint states topic, but that is only feedback.  I could not find a way to reduce torque with the ROS messages we are allowed to use.\r\n\r\nAnybody else seeing a similar issue?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>About half the time I have Val turn a wheel, it starts to turn its hand and and then when it touches the wheel itself, the whole robot acts like it got struck by lightening and then collapses to the floor.
