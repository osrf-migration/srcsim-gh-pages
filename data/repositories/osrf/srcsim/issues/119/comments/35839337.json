Can this be done at all? If not, the competition as currently planned using teleportation to skip checkpoints needs a radical change. \n\nMy understanding is the teleporting only changes the position in Gazebo. That means there is a requirement to tell the ROS, NASA and IHMC simulation components that the pose is now totally updated. It's not only the overall pose but the pose for all the other joints and components of R5. Hopefully they get updated automatically through the URDF linkages. If I were working this problem my first question would be if there are APIs in the component pieces that would handle this? \n\nMy next question is whether a discontinuous change in pose is going to be handled gracefully by the components. The IHMC software seems especially fragile with respect to discontinuities.\n\nI'm fascinated with the glimpses I see of the work going into the development of the competition. That leads me to consider the issues on the competition software side of this problem. I hope my concerns here are unfounded but thought I'd mention them just in case they are not.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Came up with a big concern about pose not being updated.
