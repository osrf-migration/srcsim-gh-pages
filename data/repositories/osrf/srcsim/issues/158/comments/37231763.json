I am able to launch a constellation, ssh into both the fc and the simulation server, and bash into the respective docker containers. However, I cannot start the simulator through the cloudsim interface (when I click to \"1\" it says request was successful, but then I could not see any activity on the simulation server side). It is guaranteed that I am missing a piece or doing something wrong, but cannot pinpoint it. \n\nSo, could you please give more details on what exactly happens in which order and where when:\n1) we launch the constellation\n2) we start simulation\n3) we start the fc\n\nAlso, following @knitfoo's advice, I located the simserver and fc AWS images, and was able to launch them. However, the VPC (and other network) settings are unknown so I wasn't able to replicate cloudsim setup exactly. \n\nWould you be able to give more information about these details? \n\nCheers,\nCetin", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi all, </p>\n<p>I've been trying to test the cloudsim setup.
