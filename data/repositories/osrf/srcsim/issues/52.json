One for the left hand and one for the right. As I understand sending commands to this topic controls the position and orientation of these unnamed/unreferenced frames. The unknown(rightHand) frame is approximately +0.1m in the x axis and -0.025 in the y axis of the (rightPalm) frame and the unknown(leftHand) is +0.1m in the x axis and -0.025 in the y axis of the (leftPalm). \r\nWith my findings I conclude that the HandTrajectory controllers have frames that aren't accessible. I tried to use the index finger for buffer but I couldn't access the fingers either as I believe they're still in progress. \r\nIs there any suggestion you can give me or will I just have to work off the right and left Palm frames and insert the offsets manually?\r\nLooking further into these frames, they seem to be the point of grasping for the robot. Were these going to be added later?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>When using ihmc's hand trajectory controller there seems to be two unreferenced frames that are being used to reference with the world frame that does not exist.
