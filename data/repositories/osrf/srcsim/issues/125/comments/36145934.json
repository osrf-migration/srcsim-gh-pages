Cutting that so far down makes the tools not work.  And we still don't have details on the actual tc parameters.  \n\nThe secondary issue is that the bandwidth is too low for using ROS messaging, specifically rviz, across the link.  We could have done so much with that interface!  Granted, the competition theme is a robot on Mars, so maybe that is just my not understanding the goals, but this approach does limit the wider applicability of the methods developed.\n\nOne of the wonderful things about ROS, and one reason we use it in our commercial robots, is that I thought I would never have to write another socket server/client again, but that is what I am doing now, with the hope of resurrecting our toolkit.  You are right, that if you do not subscribe to a topic, then it takes up no bandwidth over the link.  And also, the throttling tools are very good.  But we were planning to do more with ROS on the client side and over the link.\n\nCould you try something for me?  With an uplink limited by tc to 2kbit per second and the downlink limited to 215kbit per second (those are the halfway points of the limits for task 1), most of the time a minimal node with a single subscriber, running on the client machine, fails to find the master.  Can you see if that is true for your system too?
