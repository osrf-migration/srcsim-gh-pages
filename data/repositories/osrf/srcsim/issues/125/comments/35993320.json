I have to agree with @dan77062, and say that this is an unwelcome surprise change to the rules (decreasing the communications by a factor of more than 15000?) given that we are so close to the finals and we still haven't been told exactly how the finals are going to run.

I look forward to seeing what other teams come up with, and I am certain there will be some successes, but at this point I just don't even know what to work on.  Some of the work I've already done has been undone by recent changes.
