How much? What type?  Any limits? We had initially assumed not, but Jedediyah's image has a blue box over on the FC\n\n2) Is our run expected to be fully autonomous or is there expected to be an operator (at the OCU) doing dynamic operations? We had assumed the operator basically said \"go\" and expectation was that our code would have to do all 3 tasks to completion without any human interaction.  If that is NOT the case then many of the problems become very different. Why am I spending so much time trying to get object recognition code working for the satellite dish if I can have an operator who can look at an image and just click on the dish to identify it.\n\n3) If (1) is there is code on the FC and (2) is that the robot is fully autonomous what is the point of the OCU at all?  Everything runs on the FC and bandwidth and latency mean nothing.\n\nAny chance we could have a clear description of the expected architecture?
