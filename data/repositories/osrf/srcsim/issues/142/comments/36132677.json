It's true that jumping from one place to another can be considered odom drift.  However, with no basis for world-frame localization (random map) in the new location, it is impossible to correct for that drift and get world coordinates for the new spot. If we had a fixed map, then it would be possible to correct for the drift by doing a localization in the new place.\n\nThink of it this way.  You are on a stationary train and going to teleport from one car to another car in the train.  You may be able to figure out which car you teleported to and where you are within that car, but there is no way you can figure out where you are in the overall world without having information about how many cars you jumped over and also the path of the tracks that the train is sitting one.  In our case, that path corresponds to the walkway between the teleported sites.  It's random.
