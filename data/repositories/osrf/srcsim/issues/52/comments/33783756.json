In theory if the wrist frame was the same frame as the one used to control the trajectory of the hand, the command sent to the hand should just send the frame of the wrist to its current location. This isn't the case. Since the actual hand frame is not in the same location as the wrist frame, sending the buffer wrist frame location to control the hand causes it to not stay in its location rather move the right hand to the right and backwards just a little. Performing this action over time shows the hand slowly moving to the right and backwards. For example location of mysterious hand frame relative to world is 0, 0, 0 and the location of the wrist frame relative to world is -0.1, -0.1, 0. If you send the command for the hand to move to the location of wrist, it will command the hand to move from frame location 0, 0, 0 to -0.1, -0.1, 0. Through this method I was able to deduce that there is an offset to the hand frame. By including the offsets, the hand now moves to locations accordingly without the affect and my feedback loops keeps the wrist maintained in place or moving to desired locations. Essentially I just kept changing offsets until the hand stayed in place while the feedback loop was running.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I pull the location of the wrist frame from the buffer and input that into the command for controlling the hand trajectory by means of a feedback loop.
