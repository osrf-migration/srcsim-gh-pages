The image below shows that the transforms do not take into account the fact that the image is inverted.  The +z axis (blue) of the head frame is up relative to gravity but the lower part of the console in the point cloud is shown as \"above\" the head.  The question is: should we invert the image and return the correct physical coordinates in the world or should we use the published transforms with the result that the coordinates look correct in RViz but are in fact not physically where the light is with respect to the robot's head.  This is not a question about how TF works, but a question about the rules of the challenge.\n\n![qual1_inverted_image.png](data/bitbucket.org/repo/xEbAAe/images/2578588145-qual1_inverted_image.png)", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>In this case, understanding the ROS transforms does not answer Tom's question.
