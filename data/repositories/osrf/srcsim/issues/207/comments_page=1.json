This seems relevant because when reharnessed, the first thing that happens is she stands as tall as she can, hitting the knee joint limits -- she's trying to reach her pelvis position prior to reharnessing, which is now impossible.  She also is trying to reach her previous torso orientation. I'm wondering if this is throwing off the walk controller. <img alt=\"val_before_after.png\" src=\"data/bitbucket.org/repo/xEbAAe/images/3266145333-val_before_after.png\" /></p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2017-06-09T05:22:31.055296+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Steven Gray", "uuid": "{7470e809-c304-4b17-b986-685f31fa15c3}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B7470e809-c304-4b17-b986-685f31fa15c3%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B7470e809-c304-4b17-b986-685f31fa15c3%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e6bee642b76507eb51c2839771722e68d=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsSG-0.png"}}, "nickname": "stgray", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:e6cc7c7b-9d1b-4abe-87d5-5f0da7c863e1"}, "updated_on": "2017-06-09T05:52:44.669287+00:00", "type": "issue_comment", "id": 37475597}, {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/srcsim/issues/207/comments/37476306.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/srcsim/issues/207#comment-37476306"}}, "issue": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/srcsim/issues/207.json"}}, "type": "issue", "id": 207, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/srcsim.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/srcsim"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{c41021d9-0217-4628-999d-7f8d82f98dcb}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "srcsim", "full_name": "osrf/srcsim", "uuid": "{c41021d9-0217-4628-999d-7f8d82f98dcb}"}, "title": "Robot Discombobulated After Reharness"}, "content": {"raw": "I found that jiggling Val with the Gazebo location or orientation controls sometimes will break loose a stuck re-harness.
